1. Specifications
IMPORTANT NOTE
SQLite does not support ANY/ALL.
SQLite returns year (INT) as result of (Date - Date) operation. If you have two dates (ex.
birthday and date that person died) you can use Date2 - Date1 to find the age of that person.
Your answers should not include duplicate rows (You may use DISTINCT if needed, however,
do not eliminate useful data by using DISTINCT).

You are given the following database schema:

Trainer(trainerID, trainerName, birthDate, dateStarted)
Pokemon(pokemonID, pokemonName, pokemonType)
TrainerSet(trainerID, pokemonID)
Evolve(pokemonID1, pokemonID2)
Duel(duelID, trainerID1, trainerID2, duelDate, winnerID)
PokemonMaster(trainerID, since, rating)

Assume that this database is based on the anime series Pokemon. The data may not represent
the actual story of the anime.
